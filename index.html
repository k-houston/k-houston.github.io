         <h2>About Me</h2>
         <p>Hello, my name is Kyle Houston! I am currently enrolled in the full stack Spring C# cohort with We Can Code It. Software development has always been something I have been interested in on top of my natural love for technology. Technology has been apart of my life since I was a little kid with playing videos games and related to my current job with working at Best Buy. My future with software development is to work for a company as a full stack developer for a couple years and then learn to become a free lance software developer.</p>
         <p>The world of software has always amazed me and to start the process is so exciting. I am very thankful to be in this bootcamp to start my knowledge and my career being a software developer.</p>
